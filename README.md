# Tokeru - A MacOS TODO App

Tokeru is an innovative TODO list app designed specifically for MacOS users. Unlike traditional TODO apps, Tokeru is engineered to remain visible even when its window is not active. It minimizes into a small display showing only the top item on your TODO list, ensuring that your next task is always in sight. Clicking on Tokeru expands it to show your full TODO list, facilitating seamless task management.

# Motivation

The inspiration behind Tokeru stems from the fleeting nature of motivation and the ephemeral quality of good ideas. Have you ever felt that an idea that seemed brilliant one day feels less so the next? This realization prompted the development of Tokeru. It's common for enthusiasm to accomplish tasks to diminish over time, leaving potentially great ideas unexplored and tasks undone. Tokeru aims to address this by making it effortless to add tasks to your TODO list immediately, encouraging users to act on their motivation while it's high. By ensuring that the next action is always visible and easy to engage with, Tokeru enhances daily productivity and helps maintain a high level of motivation, making every day an opportunity to capture and act on those fleeting great ideas.

# Features

- Always Visible TODO: The top task of your TODO list remains visible even when the window is not active.
- Easy Task Addition(Inproggress): Use the shortcut (command + shift + ,) to quickly launch Tokeru and add new tasks.
- Boost Daily Productivity(Inproggress): Tasks not completed today do not automatically carry over to the next day. Every day is a fresh start, aimed at maximizing productivity.
